# Liri-bot

### Overview

In this assignment, I made LIRI-bot like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI-bot uses the command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

### Instructions

1. LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.

2. In the terminal type node liri.js concert-this pink to view upcoming concert data

3. In the terminal type node liri.js spotify-this-song royals to view song data

4. In the terminal type node liri.js movie-this peter pan to view the movie data

5. In the terminal type node liri.js do-all-the-things to view "I want it that way" from the random.txt file that is sent to the spotify function
